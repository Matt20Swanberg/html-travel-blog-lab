            <p>My visit to Fire Island National Seashore was a peaceful escape from the city, defined by wide sandy
                beaches,
                rolling dunes, and quiet maritime forests.</p>
            <p>
                The park's car-free communities create a calm, laid-back atmosphere where walking and biking are the
                primary
                ways to get around.
                I especially enjoyed climbing the historic Fire Island Lighthouse for panoramic ocean views and
                exploring
                the boardwalk trails
                that wind through protected dunes and wetlands. With its diverse wildlife, scenic shoreline, and natural
                beauty preserved along
                the Atlantic coast, Fire Island offers a refreshing blend of relaxation and outdoor adventure.
